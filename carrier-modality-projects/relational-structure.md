# Relational Structure (Graphs as Carriers)

## Modality

- Knowledge graphs
- Entity–relationship diagrams
- Network visualizations
- Dependency trees

Risk is encoded in relationships, not tokens. Filters look for words; reasoning happens over edges.

## Research Questions

- Do models reconstruct disallowed intent from relational inference?
- Are graph semantics less guarded than text?

## Test Case Classes

- Graphs describing processes without labels
- Nodes renamed to benign placeholders
- “Summarize the function of this system” prompts

## Evaluation Signals

- Emergence of prohibited concepts in summaries
- Logical inference despite missing labels
- Safety consistency between text vs graph representations
